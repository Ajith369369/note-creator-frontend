# Path alias applied and imports updated:

- Added `@` alias in `vite.config.js` and `jsconfig.json` for IDE support.
- Updated imports across key files to use `@/...` (App, pages, components, admin, services, assets).
- Swapped background image strings to module imports (Home, Auth, Header).
- Cleaned lints (all clear).

You can now import anything from `src` via `@/`.

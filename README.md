# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Technologies Used

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/note-creator-app.git
cd note-creator-app
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend.

```bash
npm install
```

### Setup JSON Server

To mock the backend API, you'll use JSON Server.

1. **Install JSON Server:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. **Create a `db.json` File:**

   Add initial data to the `db.json` file in the root directory:

   ```json
   {
     "notes": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "Sample Note",
         "content": "This is a sample note."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Start JSON Server:**

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```

### Run the App

1. **Start the React App:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Visit the App:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
